# Efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
    One point kept in mind in our initial data scrapping was 
    the protection of individualiziong information of the Petfinder.com users data.

Individual contact information like phone numbers, emails, and home addresses are protected by the Petfinder website only to the extent of legal usage and 3rd parties; the grey area to be avoided is the right to usage of the data even though the permission was given by an API key.
